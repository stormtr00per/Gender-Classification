# Gender-Classification

This is the code for the gender classification challenge for 'Learn Python for Data Science #1' by @Sirajology on YouTube. The code uses the various machine learning library to train a model on a small dataset of body metrics (height, width, and shoe size) labeled male or female. Then we can predict the gender of someone given a novel set of body metrics.
